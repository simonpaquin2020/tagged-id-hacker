**probably working yet,  but can't confirm**
tagged.com suffers from multiple vulnerabilities.
This script exploits CSRF and unprotected password changing bug in tagged.com to hack tagged.com ID

This bug was reported to tagged.com but they denied to fix it. After waiting more than 4 months, now I am publishing this bug.

#How to use?
####The process of using this script is pretty simple. If you're a bit clever you can hack anyone's tagged account (90% depending on he visits your link).
__Steps:__
* Host the script anywhere on the web where PHP script hosting is supported. (There's a lots of free services available on the web)
* Write a very good article (I mean anything in your blog or elsewhere satisfaying you have at least permission to inject some html codes like iframe //obsolete maybe)
* Now insert your script link as a hidden iframe in your blogpost or site. Now when the tagged.com user (of course logged in) visits your site will be hacked :D

_more info will be added soon_
